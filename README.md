# üöÄ C++ Modules (00-09) - Introduction and Advanced Concepts

This set of modules aims to introduce and deepen the fundamental and advanced concepts of **object-oriented programming (OOP)** using **C++**. From basic principles to complex topics, the modules are designed to build a solid understanding of C++ and its application in modern software development.

## üìã General Objective

- Understand the differences between **C and C++**.  
- Learn to use C++-specific features to solve problems efficiently.  
- Apply advanced OOP concepts, such as inheritance, polymorphism, and templates.

## üß© Modules 00-04: C++ Fundamentals

The first modules focus on teaching the pillars of object-oriented programming and introducing C++ features.

### ‚ú® Main Concepts
1. **Namespaces**: Code organization and scope.  
2. **Classes and Instances**:  
   - Creating and using classes.  
   - Attributes and member functions.  
3. **List Initialization**: Initializers for class attributes.  
4. **Use of `const` and `static`**: For defining class attributes and functions.  
5. **Comparison between `struct` and `class`**: Differences and best practices.  
6. **Memory Management**:  
   - Using `new` and `delete` for memory allocation and deallocation.  
   - Pointers and member references.  
7. **Variable Lifecycle and Scope**: Understanding how variables are created and destroyed.  
8. **Ad-Hoc Polymorphism**:  
   - Function overloading.  
   - Operator overloading.  
9. **Orthodox Canonical Classes**:  
   - Understanding constructors, destructors, and assignment operators.  
10. **Inheritance and Subtype Polymorphism**:  
    - Access specifiers (`public`, `private`, `protected`).  
    - Multiple inheritance and the diamond problem.  
    - Implementation of abstract classes and interfaces.

## üõ†Ô∏è Modules 05-09: Advanced C++ Concepts

The advanced modules explore powerful C++ functionalities, providing skills to tackle complex OOP challenges.

### ‚ú® Main Concepts
1. **Exception Handling**:  
   - Using `try`, `catch`, and `throw`.  
   - Control flow with exceptions.  
2. **Advanced Casting**:  
   - Types of casting: `static_cast`, `dynamic_cast`, `const_cast`, and `reinterpret_cast`.  
3. **C++ Templates**:  
   - Creating and using **generic functions and classes**.  
   - Working with **templated containers**, iterators, and algorithms.  
4. **Standard Template Library (STL)**:  
   - Using containers like `vector`, `map`, `set`, and `list`.  
   - Generic algorithms like `sort`, `find`, and `accumulate`.  
5. **In-Depth Algorithms and Structures**:  
   - Implementing and optimizing algorithms using templates and STL.
